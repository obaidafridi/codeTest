Here are the key points to refactor and optimize the code:

(1)The code you provided looks good in terms of following the basic principles of separation of concerns and using dependency injection to inject the repository
In this code, the test has used the Repository pattern, which is good for developing large applications and keeping the code organized. 
I believe we should also use SOLID principles to make the code more reusable and readable.

(2)i think we have used eager loading to retrieve data from the database. 
This is a good practice because it reduces the number of database queries and improves performance.
 By using with() method, we can retrieve all the necessary data in a single query, instead of making multiple queries for each related model.

(3)In terms of optimization, one suggestion would be to use a try-catch block to catch any exceptions thrown by the repository methods and return an appropriate response to the client. 
Also, you could consider using Laravel's built-in validation to validate the request data before passing it to the repository

(4)i thins shuld add comment as well with each function 

(5)Overall, the code looks good, but in the booking repository, some functions are too long. I think they should be divided into smaller modules to make the code more readable.
Separate the code into smaller methods to improve readability and maintainability.

(6)in booking respostory  storejobemail function we can refector this function Extract reusable code into methods with descriptive names: The code currently contains a lot of repetitive code. You could extract some of this code into separate methods with descriptive names. For example, you could create a method to set the job address, instructions, and town based on the data passed in.
Simplify conditionals: The current code contains a lot of nested conditionals. You could simplify some of these conditionals by using the null coalescing operator (??). For example, instead of checking if $data['address'] is set and not empty, you could use $data['address'] ?? $user->userMeta->address.
Use more descriptive variable names: Some of the variable names are not very descriptive, which can make the code harder to read. For example, $response could be renamed to something like $jobEmailResponse.

(7)Use Laravel's built-in helpers and functions, such as the optional() helper and the ?? operator, to simplify the code and make it more concise.

(8)Avoid using the '@' symbol to suppress errors, as it can make debugging more difficult.

(9)In BookingRepository having function getUsersJobs we can optimize the code like this
a. Instead of calling the jobs() method in the first if statement, eager load the related data using with() method. This way, you can retrieve all the necessary data in a single query.
b. Instead of calling the getTranslatorJobs() method in the second if statement, create a translatorJobs relationship on the User model and eager load the related data using with() method.
Simplify the if statements:
c. You can combine the two if statements into one using an in_array() check.
Use filter() method instead of foreach() loop:
d. Instead of using a foreach() loop to filter the $jobs array, use the filter() method with a closure function.
Use map() method instead of each() method:
f. Instead of using the each() method to modify the $noramlJobs array, use the map() method with a closure function.
